Notes:
1. Codes to process the raw fastq files (e.g., preprocessing, alignment, and duplicate-removal) are NOT covered here;
you may need to install [Ktrim](https://github.com/hellosunking/Ktrim/),
[bowtie2](https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml),
[Msuite2](https://github.com/hellosunking/Msuite2/),
and [samtools](https://www.htslib.org/) to perform these procedures;
2. [bedtools](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) are required to run these codes;
3. Nucleosome track is obtained from [NucMap](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/nucmap/https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/nucmap/),
